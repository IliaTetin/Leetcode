# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. 
# In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a = b = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
